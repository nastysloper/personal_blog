<h1>Learn to program</h1>
<p>Learn to program by programming. Don't just do tutorials, though: you'll learn best by
<br>
building your own projects and figuring stuff out. Repeating tasks is also valuable because
<br>
repetition will internalize the lessons you're learning. These are called katas in programming.
<br>
Pick a language or framework and stick with it. You'll learn faster and you need to focus on 
<br>
building projects over learning new languages and frameworks.</p>
